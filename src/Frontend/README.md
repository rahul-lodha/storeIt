# StoreIt Frontend

A unified storage management solution with Google SSO authentication.

## Authentication Setup

### Google OAuth 2.0 Setup

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
4. Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID"
5. Select "Web application" as the application type
6. Add your domain to the "Authorized JavaScript origins" (e.g., http://localhost:3000 for development)
7. Add your redirect URI to the "Authorized redirect URIs" (e.g., http://localhost:3000 for development)
8. Click "Create"
9. Copy the generated Client ID

### Update the Client ID in the App

Replace the placeholder Google Client ID in `src/App.tsx` with your actual Client ID:

```typescript
const googleClientId = 'YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID_HERE';
```

## Development

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Development Server

```bash
npm start
```

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

## Authentication Flow

- Users can sign in using Google SSO or email/password
- Authentication state is stored in localStorage
- Protected routes require authentication
- The app includes a logout function that clears authentication data

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
